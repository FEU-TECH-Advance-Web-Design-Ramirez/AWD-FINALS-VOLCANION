        <div class="cuisine-title">Italian Cuisine: A Taste of Tradition and Innovation</div>
        <p class="cuisine-description">
            Italian cuisine blends timeless tradition with modern creativity, making it one of the world's most beloved culinary experiences. Rooted in regional diversity, it goes beyond pasta and pizza, reflecting a deep connection to culture and quality ingredients.
            <br><br>
            Italian food emphasizes simplicity and fresh, high-quality ingredients. Each region has its specialties: Northern Italy offers creamy risottos and rich meats, while Southern Italy favors bold tomato-based dishes and seafood. Classics like Pasta Carbonara, Osso Buco, and Margherita Pizza showcase this rich heritage. Meals are central to family traditions, passed down through generations and enjoyed at a leisurely pace.
            <br><br>
            While tradition prevails, Italian cuisine evolves with contemporary influences. Chefs experiment with truffle-infused pasta, gourmet pizzas, and plant-based adaptations like zucchini noodles and dairy-free gelato. Modern techniques, including molecular gastronomy, add artistic flair to Italian dishes.
