        <p class="culture-description">
            Spain’s rich cultural heritage is a blend of diverse influences, from Moorish and Roman 
            legacies to vibrant regional traditions. Each part of the country has its own distinct customs, 
            yet all share a deep appreciation for history, art, and celebration. Whether through grand festivals, 
            architectural masterpieces, or deep-rooted traditions, Spain’s culture is a testament to its dynamic past 
            and present.
            <br><br>
            One of the most defining aspects of Spanish culture is its love for festivals and celebrations. 
            Events like La Tomatina, where thousands engage in a friendly tomato-throwing battle, and Semana Santa, 
            a solemn Holy Week procession, showcase the country’s passion for both revelry and devotion. 
            Flamenco, a powerful blend of music, dance, and emotion, is another iconic tradition that reflects the soul 
            of Spain, particularly in Andalusia.
            <br><br>
            Spanish culture is also deeply connected to its culinary heritage, family values, and artistic achievements. 
            Cuisine like tapas and paella brings people together, while traditions like the siesta emphasize relaxation. 
            Spain’s art and architecture, from Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí to Antoni Gaudí, further enrich its cultural 
            legacy. Through its traditions and creativity, Spain continues to inspire the world.
